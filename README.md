**note:** this version of my site is old and not up to date. go [here](https://github.com/aczw/personal-website) for the new site repo and [here](https://charleszw.com) for my current site :)

welcome to my personal website. it was made using the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg), namely Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. some items of interest, maybe:

- `/`: home page
- `/ttt`: tic-tac-toe (now hosted at [ttt.charleszw.com](https://ttt.charleszw.com))

I wanted to have my own little corner on the internet, and along the way learned some web dev as well. take a look around and lemme know what you think.
